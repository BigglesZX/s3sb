Welcome to the s3sb README. This file should, if you're lucky (and if
I've finished writing it), contain everything you need to know to get s3sb
running in your environment.

This file will change along with s3sb itself, as different features are
improved and old behaviours retired. The time I have available to work on
projects like s3sb varies immensely, so I'll try to make sure this file 
stays up to date - even in describing behaviours that will soon be
retired - so that you can use s3sb whatever state it's in.


// 0x01 . What is s3sb?  /////////////////////////////////////////////////

In one sentence, s3sb - S3 Site Backup - is a Bash shell script designed
to back up whole websites - files and database contents - on to Amazon S3.

It allows you to specify a directory where files are located, as well as 
connection details for the database used by that site, and when executed 
it will pack up those files into a .tar.gz file, dump the database into a 
.sql.gz file, then upload both those files to an Amazon S3 account, filing
them neatly into a bucket named after the site. Timestamps are included in
the filenames to help future retrieval. How useful!

s3sb was designed to fulfil a need I had in a shared hosting environment.
Your environment may differ, so I'm trying to ensure that s3sb can cope 
with a variety of hosting scenarios so that it can be as helpful to you as
it is to me. It probably won't be perfect yet, but I'm working on it.

s3sb makes use of the s3-bash library created by Raphael James Cohn 
(http://code.google.com/p/s3-bash/). The library hasn't been updated since
version 0.02 in late 2007, so I have made a few tweaks to the code to 
remedy a few issues. Accordingly, s3sb includes the s3-bash files required
to get the whole thing running. As s3-bash is licensed under Apache 
License 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), so is s3sb. See
the LICENSE file for more details.
