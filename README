// 0x00 . Intro  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Welcome to the s3sb README. This file should, if you're lucky (and if
I've finished writing it), contain everything you need to know to get s3sb
running in your environment.

This file will change along with s3sb itself, as different features are
improved and old behaviours retired. The time I have available to work on
projects like s3sb varies immensely, so I'll try to make sure this file 
stays up to date - even in describing behaviours that will soon be
retired - so that you can use s3sb whatever state it's in.


// 0x01 . What is s3sb?  /////////////////////////////////////////////////

In one sentence, s3sb - S3 Site Backup - is a Bash shell script designed
to back up whole websites - files and database contents - on to Amazon S3.

It allows you to specify a directory where files are located, as well as 
connection details for the database used by that site, and when executed 
it will pack up those files into a .tar.gz file, dump the database into a 
.sql.gz file, then upload both those files to an Amazon S3 account, filing
them neatly into a bucket named after the site. Timestamps are included in
the filenames to help future retrieval. How useful!

s3sb was designed to fulfil a need I had in a shared hosting environment.
Your environment may differ, so I'm trying to ensure that s3sb can cope 
with a variety of hosting scenarios so that it can be as helpful to you as
it is to me. It probably won't be perfect yet, but I'm working on it.

s3sb makes use of the s3-bash library created by Raphael James Cohn 
(http://code.google.com/p/s3-bash/). The library hasn't been updated since
version 0.02 in late 2007, so I have made a few tweaks to the code to 
remedy a few issues. Accordingly, s3sb includes the s3-bash files required
to get the whole thing running. As s3-bash is licensed under Apache 
License 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), so is s3sb. See
the LICENSE file for more details.

// 0x02 . Prerequisites  /////////////////////////////////////////////////

s3sb is designed to be run from shell or crontab, so you'll need a UNIX-
like environment in which to do that. s3sb should run without issue on Mac
OS X, but this hasn't been tested as much as Linux. Windows (Cygwin) has 
not been tested at all. You're welcome to submit patches to address any 
OS-specific deficiency.

The heart of s3sb's functionality is of course its interfacing with Amazon
S3. So you'll need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, first and 
foremost. Once you've initialised S3 on your AWS account, you'll need your
"key" and "secret key" strings in order to allow s3sb access to your S3 
account. Instructions for setting up your key and secret keys in the s3sb 
config files are provided in the Installation and Configuration section.

Since s3sb includes the s3-bash library, you will also need to satisfy the
dependencies of that library. They are GNU coreutils, curl and openssl.
Please see the documentation for your system for instructions on getting 
those packages installed (you've probably got them installed already, 
however, if you're using any recent version of a Linux distribution).

As previously mentioned, I've tweaked the bundled version of s3-bash to 
fix a few issues that were present in the stock code. Please see the 
s3-bash Issues page on Google Code 
(http://code.google.com/p/s3-bash/issues/list) for full details on the 
bugs. The fixes are:

  > Issues #6 and #11
  A bug in the way headers were signed, fixed thanks to the patch provided
  by batlogg on Issue #11.

  > Issue #7
  A URL-forming bug preventing the use of European S3 buckets, fixed 
  thanks to the patch provided by jon.keys

  > Issue #17
  URLencode entities (e.g. %20) in filenames would break put operations. 
  Fixed thanks to the suggestion in the Issue comments from "admin".

Feel free to use the code from my updated s3-bash files to patch your own 
s3-bash installation. The Google Code project for s3-bash has seen very 
little activity since the 0.02 release in 2007 so it's unlikely that 
official updates will be forthcoming any time soon.
